                    <h1>Ignoring This Website Essential Can Hurt Your Search Ranking — and Bring Legal Consequences</h1>
                  </article>
                  <article><p>hile many businesses value accessibility in principle, implementing it in specific ways that benefit both your customers and your business can feel daunting.

One study found that 95% of websites fail to conform to accessibility standards required by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
                    Some of the downsides of not being fully accessible are obvious, including legal consequences, a negative brand image and a failure to engage with and support people with disabilities. While accessibility is clearly a good thing on its own and may be legally required depending on your location, it also impacts your website's SEO.</p></article>
